##CPSC1020 Review

The purpose of this repo is to help students prepare for the coming semester. 
This repo will be public at the end of our review session on Friday, 30 August. 
Students should review the material closely and work through the programming assignments. 
This is not for a grade in CPSC1020 nor CPSCP1021, but serves strictly to help 
students come to speed with basic programming techniques in C before we pivot into
C++.
